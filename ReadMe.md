# Real Estate Sales Performance Dashboard

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on building a comprehensive **Power BI dashboard** to analyze real estate sales and rental performance across major Indian cities such as **Bangalore, Mumbai, Pune, New Delhi, and Nagpur**. The dashboard provides meaningful insights into property trends using clean, structured, and well-processed data.

## Purpose of the Project  
The main objective is to understand rental behavior, pricing patterns, and property distribution across cities. It helps stakeholders make informed decisions by visualizing real estate performance through interactive charts and summary metrics.

## Key Insights Covered  
The dashboard analyzes **total properties, average rent, total area, and rental distribution** across cities.  
It also evaluates **BHK types, furnishing status, and property categories** to identify high-demand and high-return segments.

## Data Cleaning Process (Power Query Steps)

### 1. Source  
Data is imported from the original source into Power Query for transformation.

### 2. Promoted Headers  
The first row is converted into column headers for proper identification.

### 3. Changed Type  
Each column is assigned the correct data type such as text, number, or date.

### 4. Removed Duplicate Records  
Duplicate entries are removed to maintain data accuracy.

### 5. Removed Blank Rows  
Empty or null rows are eliminated to ensure clean analysis.

### 6. Duplicated Columns  
Specific columns are duplicated when transformations are needed without affecting original data.

### 7. Reordered Columns  
Columns are rearranged logically for better readability and analysis flow.

### 8. Split Column by Position  
Fixed-length values are separated into multiple columns where required.

### 9. Split Column by Delimiter  
Columns containing combined values are split using delimiters like commas or hyphens.

### 10. Replaced Null and Error Values  
Missing and error values are replaced to avoid calculation issues.

### 11. Removed Unnecessary Columns  
Irrelevant fields are removed to keep the dataset clean and optimized.

### 12. Renamed Columns  
Columns are renamed for better clarity and understanding.

### 13. Sorted Rows  
Data is sorted to improve readability and support accurate visual analysis.

## Final Outcome  
This end-to-end process results in a clean, structured, and analysis-ready dataset.  
The dashboard effectively showcases real estate trends, supports business decision-making, and demonstrates strong data analytics and Power BI skills.

## Conclusion  
This project serves as a complete real-world example of data preparation, transformation, and visualization, making it ideal for portfolios, interviews, and professional analytics use cases.
